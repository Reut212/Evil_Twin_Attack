# Evil Twin Attack

> **An evil twin attack takes place when an attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point hoping that users will connect to it instead of a legitimate one. When users connect to this access point, all the data they share with the network passes through a server controlled by the attacker. An attacker can create an evil twin with a smartphone or other internet-capable device and some readily available software. Evil twin attacks are more common on public Wi-Fi networks which are unsecured and leave your personal data vulnerable.**





#### To Attack Use:

```
git clone https://github.com/Wireless-Network-Security/Evil-Twin.git
cd Evil-Twin
sudo sh sattack.sh
```
